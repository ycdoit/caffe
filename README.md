# Distributed Training For Caffe With Multiverso 

## Introduction
  - [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors.
  - [Multiverso](https://github.com/Microsoft/multiverso) is a parameter server based framework for training machine learning models on big data with numbers of machines.
  - In this project, we leverage Multiverso to help Caffe speed up training performance with multiple machines.
